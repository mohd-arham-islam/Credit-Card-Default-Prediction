# Email Campaign Effectiveness Prediction
The aim of this machine learning (ML) project is to develop a model that can effectively analyze and track emails sent as part of Gmail-based email marketing strategies employed by small to medium-sized business owners. The goal is to classify emails based on their characteristics and monitor their recipients' engagement, distinguishing between emails that are ignored, read, or acknowledged.

The ML model will be trained on a dataset containing a diverse range of emails, encompassing different email types, email campaigns, etc. It will learn to discern patterns and features within the emails that can be indicative of recipient behavior. By analyzing these characteristics, the model will be able to predict whether an email is likely to be ignored, read, or acknowledged by the recipient.

The successful implementation of this project will provide valuable insights to business owners regarding the effectiveness of their email marketing campaigns. By identifying emails that are being ignored, businesses can refine their strategies and optimize their content to improve engagement rates. Conversely, understanding which emails are being read or acknowledged can help identify successful tactics that can be replicated in future campaigns.
