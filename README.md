# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to forecast the likelihood of customers defaulting on their credit card payments in Taiwan. The project's primary objective is to enhance risk management by accurately estimating the probability of default, which is deemed more valuable than a simple binary classification of clients as credible or not credible.

To achieve this, the project utilizes a dataset consisting of various informative fields related to credit card usage and customer demographics. The dataset includes the following key features:

Amount: Credit amount refers to the amount of credit granted to the customers by the credit card issuer.

Gender: This field captures the gender of the credit card holders, distinguishing between male and female customers.

Education: Educational qualification records the level of education attained by the customers, providing insights into their educational backgrounds.

Marital Status: This field indicates whether the customers are married or not, offering a glimpse into their marital status.

Age: Age represents the age of the customers, providing an understanding of their age demographics.

History of Past Payments: This field tracks the payment behavior of the customers in the past, reflecting their payment history.

Amount of Bill Statement: Bill amount corresponds to the amount billed to the customers on their credit card statements.

Amount of Previous Payment: Previous amount paid records the sum of the payments made by the customers in the previous billing cycle.

The project employs these features to train a machine learning model capable of predicting the probability of default. By utilizing advanced classification techniques and predictive analytics, the model can generate accurate estimates of the likelihood that a customer will default on their credit card payments.

By successfully predicting the probability of default, financial institutions and credit card issuers in Taiwan can improve their risk management strategies. They can proactively identify customers who are at a higher risk of defaulting and take appropriate measures to mitigate potential losses. This project's focus on estimating the probability of default rather than a binary classification enables more nuanced and informed decision-making regarding credit card customers.
